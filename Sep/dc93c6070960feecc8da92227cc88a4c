An account has just reached London of how Miss Sheila MacDonald, a 22-year-old London girl, climbed the African mountain Kilimanjaro, the first time the feat has been accomplished by a woman; how she set the pace for her two men companions, slept in caves, and sustained herself with champagne drunk from the bottle, and how, in spite of one of the men being forced to give up through physical exhaustion, she pressed on undaunted to the summit. Miss MacDonald is a tall, well-built girl with shingled hair, who excels in outdoor games and horse-riding. Her first trials in mountaineering were done at the age of twelve, when with her father, Mr. Claude MacDonald, of Lancaster Gate, London, a member of the Alpine Club, she made ascents of several Scottish mountains. In later years she climbed Etna, and with another girl risked an angry sea in a small open boat on their return from an ascent of Stromboli. Miss MacDonald went to East Africa in July to stay with relatives. Mr. William C. West. F.R.G.S., also a member of the Alpine Club, who was one of the party, said: “Kilimanjaro was not likely to terrorise Miss MacDonald, who calmly contemplates a return trip alone down the Nile, and who is at present on safari, routing out particularly obstreperous lions on the southern game preserve.” Major O. Lennox Browne, a mountaineer of some experience, was the third member of the party. Kilimanjaro is in the territory of British Tanganyika, and is 19,720 feet high, Mawenzi being about 2,000 feet lower. Both peaks are capped with snow in spite of the nearness of the equator, which is only 180 miles away, and both have well-marked craters at the summit. Read a full account of the ascent.
